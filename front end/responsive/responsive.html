        With the wide-spread adoption of viewport units in browsers, we can finally achieve what I call fluid typography. By this, I mean type that inherently fits in its surroundings, not by reflowing, but by resizing, keeping size relationships, line-heights, and copy-fitting in tact. This shift means less caveats in our designs, and in our markup. Less work, for better output, resulting in more project time to worry about things like performance budgets.

        The Styling of text is made by altering two things: fonts and text layout. Those are among the most basic things done early on while learning CSS.
